    <verse n="1">The Lord is my shepherd; <caesura/> I shall not want.</verse>

    <verse n="2"> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:<caesura/> he leadeth me beside the
        still waters.</verse>

    <verse n="3"> He restoreth my soul:<caesura/> he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
        his name's sake.</verse>

    <verse n="4"> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
        evil:<caesura/> for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</verse>

    <verse n="5"> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:<caesura/> thou
        anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</verse>

    <verse n="6"> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:<caesura/> and I
        will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</verse>
