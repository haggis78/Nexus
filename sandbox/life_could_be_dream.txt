Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream
Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom
Life could be a dream
Sh-boom, if I could take you to a paradise up above
If you will tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart, hello, hello again
Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom
Life could be a dream
If only all my precious plans would come true
If you would let me spend my whole life loving you
Life could be a dream, sweetheart (do-roo-do-do, sh-boom)
Every time I look at you
Something is on my mind
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we'd be so fine
Oh, life could be a dream
Sh-boom, if I could take you to a paradise up above
Sh-boom, and tell me, darling, I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart, hello, hello again
Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom
Oh, life could be a dream
Life could be a dream, sweetheart
Whoa, life could be a dream
Sh-boom, if I could take you up to paradise up above
Sh-boom, and tell me, darling, I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart, hello, hello again
Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom
Oh, life could be a dream
Life could be a dream
Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom
