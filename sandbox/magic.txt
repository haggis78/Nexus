Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart?
How the music can free her whenever it starts
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout a rock 'n' roll
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me
And maybe if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow sorta late at night
And we'll go dancing baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music, and the music's in me
Yeah, do you believe in magic?
Yeah, believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ahh, talking 'bout the magic
Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
