# Troubleshooting

When you're stuck on a coding assignment or project file, and you want some help debugging something wrong, you can push your code to this directory and the class can do a `git pull` to pull it in and take a look at it and offer comments. You should also open an issue on the DHClass-Hub Issue board about the problem you're having and write it up in markdown like we are doing here, so we know there is something we should be looking at!

When you write up your issue, if you want to include some code, try using a markdown code block using tick marks (upper left of your keyboard). You can see the tick marks we're using in this markdown file by going to edit it and looking at it in edit view:

```
<code>....</code>

```

This Troubleshooting directory should be used together with the Issues board, because you can link directly to code you push to the remote DHClass-Hub so we can see which file we're looking for when we pull it in. We can also do "line-commenting" on your code here (we'll show you how).

While you work, practice using the command line. Basic shell commands, including 'cd', 'ls', and 'cat' will allow you to navigate your local machine easily.
