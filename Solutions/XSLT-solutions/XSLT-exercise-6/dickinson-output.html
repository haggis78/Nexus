            1: Before I got my eye put out—<br />
            2: I liked as well to see<br />
            3: As other Creatures, that have Eyes—<br />
            4: And know no other way—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: But were it told to me, Today,<br />
            6: That I might have the Sky<br />
            7: For mine, I tell you that my Heart<br />
            8: Would split, for size of me—
            
         </p>
         <p>

            <br />
            16: For mine—to look at when I liked <br />
            17: The news would strike me dead—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            18: So safer—guess—with just my soul<br />

            4: Distinctness—easy—seems—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: The Shapes we buried, dwell about,<br />

         <p>
            9: In just the Jacket that he wore—<br />
            10: Long buttoned in the Mold<br />
            11: Since we—old mornings, Children—played—<br />
            12: Divided by a world—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            13: The Grave yields back her Robberies—<br />

            15: Bright Knots of Apparitions<br />
            16: Salute us with their wings—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            17: As we—it were—that perished—<br />
            18: Themself—had just remained till we rejoin them—<br />
            19: And 'twas they, and not ourself<br />
            20: That mourned.

            2: Then, I am ready to go!<br />
            3: Just look at the Horses—<br />

         </p>
         <p>
            5: Put me in on the

            <span class="var1">tightest </span>
            <span class="var2">highest—</span>
            side—<br />
            6: So I shall never fall—<br />
            7: For we must ride to the Judgment—<br />
            8: 
            
            <span class="var0">And it's partly, down Hill—</span>
            <span class="var1">And it's many a mile—the Hills—</span>
            
            
            
         </p>
         <p>
            9: But I never mind the

            <span class="var1">Bridges</span>
            
            <br />
            10: And I never mind the Sea—<br />
            11: Held fast in Everlasting Race—<br />
            12: By my own Choice, and Thee—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            13: Goodbye to the Life I used to live—<br />
            14: And the World I used to know—<br />
            15: And kiss the Hills, for me, just once—<br />
            16: 
            <span class="var0">Then—</span>
            <span class="var1">Now </span>

         <p>
            1: I like a look of Agony,<br />
            2: Because I know it's true—<br />
            3: Men do not sham Convulsion,<br />
            4: Nor simulate a Throe—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: 
            
            <span class="var0">Death comes</span>
            
            <br />
            6: The Eyes glaze once—and—that is Death—<br />
            7: Impossible to feign<br />
            8: The Beads upon the Forehead<br />
            9: By homely Anguish strung.
            
         </p>
         <h2 id="p1605">Poem 5 (J 280: 1861/1896)</h2>
         <p>
            1: I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br />
            2: And Mourners to and fro <br />
            3: Kept treading—treading—till it seemed <br />
            4: That Sense was breaking through— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: And when they were all seated, <br />
            6: A Service, like a Drum— <br />
            7: Kept beating—beating—till I thought <br />
            8: My Mind was going numb— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            9: And then I heard them lift a Box <br />
            10: And creak across my Soul <br />
            11: With those same Boots of lead, again, <br />
            12: Then Space began to toll, 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            13: As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br />
            14: And Being, but an Ear, <br />
            15: And I, and Silence, some strange Race <br />
            16: Wrecked, solitary, here— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            17: And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br />
            18: And I dropped down, and down— <br />
            19: And hit a World, at every 
            <span class="var0">plunge,</span>
            <span class="var1">Crash—</span>
            
            <br />
            20: 
            
            <span class="var0">And Finished </span>
            <span class="var1">And Got through—</span>
            knowing—then—

         <h2 id="p1606">Poem 6 (J 281: 1861/1935)</h2>
         <p>
            1: 'Tis so appalling—it exhilarates— <br />
            2: 
            
            <span class="var0">So over Horror, it half Captivates—</span>
            <span class="var1">So over Horror, it dumb fascinates—</span>
            
            <br />
            3: The Soul stares after it, secure— <br />
            4: 
            
            <span class="var0">To know the worst, leaves no dread more—</span>
            <span class="var1">A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more—</span>
            
            
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: To scan a Ghost, is faint— <br />
            6: But grappling, conquers it— <br />
            7: How easy Torment, now— <br />
            8: Suspense kept sawing so— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            9: The Truth, is Bald, and Cold— <br />
            10: But that will hold— <br />
            11: If any are not sure— <br />
            12: We show them—prayer— <br />
            13: But we, who know, <br />
            14: Stop hoping, now— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            15: Looking at Death, is Dying— <br />
            16: Just let go the Breath— <br />
            17: And not the pillow at your Cheek <br />
            18: So Slumbereth— 
            
         </p>
         <p>
            19: Others, Can wrestle— <br />
            20: Yours, is done— <br />
            21: And so of Woe, bleak dreaded—come, <br />
            22: It sets the Fright at liberty— <br />
            23: And Terror's free— <br />
            24: Gay, Ghastly, Holiday!

            1: How noteless Men and Pleiads, stand,<br />
            2: Until a sudden sky<br />
            3: Reveals the fact that One is rapt<br />
            4: Forever from the Eye—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: Members of the Invisible,<br />
            6: Existing while we stare,<br />
            7: In Leagueless Opportunity,<br />
            8: O'ertakeless, as the Air—

            <span class="var0">Without a syllable—</span>
            <span class="var1">But deign no syllable</span>

         <p>
            1: When we stand on top of Things—<br />
            2: And like the Trees, look down—<br />
            3: The smoke all cleared away from it—<br />
            4: And Mirrors on the scene—

            1: 'Twas just this time, last year, I died.<br />
            2:  I know I heard the Corn,<br />
            3: When I was carried by the Farms—<br />
            4: It had the Tassels on—
            
         </p>
         <p>
            5: I thought how yellow it would look—<br />
            6: When Richard went to mill—<br />
            7: And then, I wanted to get out,<br />
            8: But something held my will.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            9: I thought just how red—Apples wedged<br />
            10: The Stubble's joints between—<br />
            11: And carts stooping round the fields<br />
            12: To take the Pumpkins in—

         <p>
            13: I wondered which would miss me, least,<br />
            14: And when Thanksgiving, came,<br />
            15: If father'd multiply the plates—<br />

         <p>
            17: And would it blur the Christmas glee<br />
            18: My Stocking hand too high<br />
            19: For any Santa Claus to reach<br />
            20: The Altitude of me—

         <p>
            21: But this sort, grieved myself,<br />
            22: And so, I thought the other way,<br />
            23: And just this time, some perfect year—<br />
            24: Themself, should come to me—
