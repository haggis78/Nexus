         Of nearness to her Sundered Things<br />
         The Soul has special times—<br />
         When Dimness—looks the Oddity—<br />
         Distinctness—easy—seems—<br />
         
         
         The Shapes we buried, dwell about,<br />
         Familiar, in the Rooms—<br />
         Untarnished by the Sepulchre,<br />
         
         
         The
         Our
          Mouldering Playmate comes—<br />
         
         
         In just the Jacket that he wore—<br />
         Long buttoned in the Mold<br />
         Since we—old mornings, Children—played—<br />
         Divided by a world—<br />
         
         
         The Grave yields back her Robberies—<br />
         The Years, our pilfered Things—<br />
         Bright Knots of Apparitions<br />
         Salute us with their wings—<br />
         
         
         As we—it were—that perished—<br />
         Themself—had just remained till we rejoin them—<br />
         And 'twas they, and not ourself<br />
         That mourned.<br />
         
         
         
         <h2 id="p1607">Poem 7. (J 282: 1861/1929)</h2>
         
         How noteless Men and Pleiads, stand,<br />
         Until a sudden sky<br />
         Reveals the fact that One is rapt<br />
         Forever from the Eye—<br />
         
         
         Members of the Invisible,<br />
         Existing while we stare,<br />
         In Leagueless Opportunity,<br />
         O'ertakeless, as the Air—<br />
         
         
         Why didn't we 
         detain Them?
         retain Them?
         detain it?
         
         <br />
         The Heavens with a smile,<br />
         Sweep by our disappointed Heads<br />
         
         Without a syllable—
         But deign no syllable
         
         <br />

         He showed me Hights I never saw—<br />
         "Would'st Climb," —He said?<br />
         I said—"Not so"—<br />
         "With me—" He said—"With me"?<br />
         He showed me Secrets—Morning's Nest—<br />
         The Rope the Nights were put across—<br />
         "And now—"Would'st have me for a Guest"?<br />
         I could not find my "Yes".<br />
         
         
         And then, He brake His Life—And lo,<br />
         A Light, for me, did solemn glow,<br />
         
         The steadier, as my face withdrew
         The larger—as my face withdrew
         
         <br />
         And could I, further, "No"?<br />
         
         
         
         <h2 id="p1608">Poem 8 (J 242: 1861/1945)</h2>
         
         When we stand on top of Things—<br />
         And like the Trees, look down—<br />
         The smoke all cleared away from it—<br />
         And Mirrors on the scene—<br />
         
         
         Just laying light—no soul will wink<br />
         Except it have a flaw—<br />
         The Sound ones, like the Hills
         
         —shall stand—
         —stand up—
         
         <br />
         No Lightening, 
         scares away—
         drives away—
         
         <br />
         
         
         The Perfect, nowhere be afraid—<br />
         They bear their<br />
         
         dauntless Heads,
         fearless—Heads,
         tranquil—Heads,
         
         <br />
         Where others, dare not 
         go at Noon,
         walk at noon,
         
         <br />
         Protected by their deeds—<br />
         
         
         The Stars dare shine occasionally<br />
         Upon a spotted World—<br />
         And Suns, go surer, for their Proof, <br />
         As if 
         An Axle, held—
         A Muscle—held
         
         <br />
         
         
         
         <h2 id="p1605">Poem 5 (J 280: 1861/1896)</h2>
         
         I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br />
         And Mourners to and fro <br />
         Kept treading—treading—till it seemed <br />
         That Sense was breaking through— <br />
         
         
         And when they were all seated, <br />
         A Service, like a Drum— <br />
         Kept beating—beating—till I thought <br />
         My Mind was going numb— <br />
         
         
         And then I heard them lift a Box <br />
         And creak across my Soul <br />
         With those same Boots of lead, again, <br />
         Then Space began to toll, <br />
         
         
         As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br />
         And Being, but an Ear, <br />
         And I, and Silence, some strange Race <br />
         Wrecked, solitary, here— <br />
         
         
         And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br />
         And I dropped down, and down— <br />
         And hit a World, at every 
         plunge,
         Crash—
         
         <br />
         
         
         And Finished 
         And Got through—
         knowing—then—<br />
         
         
         
         <h2 id="p1606">Poem 6 (J 281: 1861/1935)</h2>
         
         'Tis so appalling—it exhilarates— <br />
         
         
         So over Horror, it half Captivates—
         So over Horror, it dumb fascinates—
         
         <br />
         The Soul stares after it, secure— <br />
         
         
         To know the worst, leaves no dread more—
         A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more—
         
         <br />
         
         
         To scan a Ghost, is faint— <br />
         But grappling, conquers it— <br />
         How easy Torment, now— <br />
         Suspense kept sawing so— <br />
         
         
         The Truth, is Bald, and Cold— <br />
         But that will hold— <br />
         If any are not sure— <br />
         We show them—prayer— <br />
         But we, who know, <br />
         Stop hoping, now— <br />
         
         
         Looking at Death, is Dying— <br />
         Just let go the Breath— <br />
         And not the pillow at your Cheek <br />
         So Slumbereth— <br />
         
         
         Others, Can wrestle— <br />
         Yours, is done— <br />
         And so of Woe, bleak dreaded—come, <br />
         It sets the Fright at liberty— <br />
         And Terror's free— <br />
         Gay, Ghastly, Holiday! <br />

         Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord, <br />
         Then, I am ready to go!<br />
         Just look at the Horses—<br />
         Rapid! That will do!<br />
         
         
         Put me in on the 
         firmest 
         tightest 
         highest—
         side—<br />
         So I shall never fall—<br />
         For we must ride to the Judgment—<br />
         
         
         And it's partly, down Hill—
         And it's many a mile—the Hills—
         
         <br />
         
         
         But I never mind the 
         steepest
         Bridges
         
         <br />
         And I never mind the Sea—<br />
         Held fast in Everlasting Race—<br />
         By my own Choice, and Thee—<br />
         
         
         Goodbye to the Life I used to live—<br />
         And the World I used to know—<br />
         And kiss the Hills, for me, just once—<br />
         
         Then—
         Now 
         Here's a keepsake for 
          I am ready to go!<br />

         'Twas just this time, last year, I died.<br />
          I know I heard the Corn,<br />
         When I was carried by the Farms—<br />
         It had the Tassels on—<br />
         
         
         I thought how yellow it would look—<br />
         When Richard went to mill—<br />
         And then, I wanted to get out,<br />
         But something held my will.<br />
         
         
         I thought just how red—Apples wedged<br />
         The Stubble's joints between—<br />
         And carts stooping round the fields<br />
         To take the Pumpkins in—<br />
         
         
         I wondered which would miss me, least,<br />
         And when Thanksgiving, came,<br />
         If father'd multiply the plates—<br />
         To make an even Sum—<br />
         
         
         And would it blur the Christmas glee<br />
         My Stocking hand too high<br />
         For any Santa Claus to reach<br />
         The Altitude of me—<br />
         
         
         But this sort, grieved myself,<br />
         And so, I thought the other way,<br />
         And just this time, some perfect year—<br />
         Themself, should come to me—<br />

         I like a look of Agony,<br />
         Because I know it's true—<br />
         Men do not sham Convulsion,<br />
         Nor simulate a Throe—<br />
         
         
         
         
         Death comes
         
         <br />
         The Eyes glaze once—and—that is Death—<br />
         Impossible to feign<br />
         The Beads upon the Forehead<br />
         By homely Anguish strung.<br />
         
         
         
         
         <h2 id="p1601">Poem 1 (J 327: 1862/1891)</h2>
         
         Before I got my eye put out—<br />
         I liked as well to see<br />
         As other Creatures, that have Eyes—<br />
         And know no other way—<br />
         
         
         But were it told to me, Today,<br />
         That I might have the Sky<br />
         For mine, I tell you that my Heart<br />
         Would split, for size of me—<br />
         
         
         The Meadows—mine—<br />
         The Mountains—mine— <br />
         All Forests—Stintless Stars—<br />
         As much of noon, as I could take—<br />
         Between my finite Eyes—<br />
         
         
         The Motions of the Dipping Birds—<br />
         The 
         Lightning's jointed Road—
         Morning's Amber Road—
         
         <br />
         For mine—to look at when I liked <br />
         The news would strike me dead—<br />
         
         
         So safer—guess—with just my soul<br />
         Upon the window pane<br />
         Where other Creatures put their Eyes<br />
         Incautious of the Sun—<br />

         Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?<br />
         Not Death—for who is He?<br />
         The Porter of my father's Lodge<br />
         As much abasheth me!<br />
         
         
         Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear thing<br />
         That comprehendeth me<br />
         In one or 
         two existences
         more—existences
         
         <br />
         
         Just as the case may be
         As Deity decree—
         
         <br />
         
         
         
         Of Resurrection? Is the East<br />
         Afraid to trust the Morn<br />
         With her fastidious forehead?<br />
         As soon impeach my Crown!<br />
