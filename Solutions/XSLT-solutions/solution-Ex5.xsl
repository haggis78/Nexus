Since 2015 HTML 5 has preferred use of <main>, though <main> can only be used once per HTML document and <div type-"main"> can probably be used more than once if desired. See http://html5doctor.com/the-main-element/ . Anyway, neither of them is really needed here to make the XSLT work to output functional HTML. You could comment it out and it would work the same.-->

Notice how this helps us to control white space in our output: I have inserted a single controlled space in front of the first square bracket of [Variants: ...] this way.
        We are outputing a count of the Variants in each poem by counting the number of times the <rdg> element appears. In the next exercise this count() will give us a way to sort the poems based on how many variants they contain.

            NOTE: You may have observed in your output that some of our titles are inconsistently formatted! Some poem numbers have a period after them, and some only white space before the parenthetical information that summarizes each poem's publication history. An Optional Challenge for the next assignment is to find a way to:
        a) output only the poem and its number in the part of the document where you reproduce the poems, and/or
        b) remove the rogue period from the output, using the replace() function.
       We'll show you how we did both of these things in our solution to XSLT Exercise 6.-->

        <!--ebb: 
            1) Notice how we handled the numbering of lines, using the count() function and the preceding:: axis. 
            This works to read and count the preceding:: l inside each specific poem file in our collection. 
            2) For the xsl:if test, we actually wanted to deal with sibling elements, children of the same parent <lg>. 
            This is how we tested to see where to position a <br/> element, and prevent it from being output on the last line of a line-group. If there is a following-sibling <l>, then output a <br/>. When there is no following-sibling <l>, then, we will not output the unnecessary <br/> at the end of a <p>.-->

    </xsl:template>
    <!--ebb: This last template rule matches our <rdg> elements in order to wrap an HTML <span> around each one and give it a distinct @class attribute. This will help us to style variants using CSS or manipulate them with JavaScript later, but for now, it ensures that the HTML retains the information on Dickinson's variants that we have coded in our XML.-->
