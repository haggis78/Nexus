# Nexus
This is the GitHub meeting point for Dr. Campbell's Digital Humanities classes at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg.

In order for you to participate fully in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write to me to tell me how to find you.

Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer.

Always be sure to "sync" your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. At command line, that means issue a "git pull"  command to retrieve changes to the directories from the cloud before you begin working. Always sync your local directory with our cloud directory here on the web when you begin work, and when you conclude work at a local computer.
